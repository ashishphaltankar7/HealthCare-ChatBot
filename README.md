# Healthcare Chatbot

The Healthcare Chatbot is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide medical information and assistance to users. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, the chatbot can understand user queries, respond to them in both text and voice format, and offer relevant medical advice and information.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries and extract relevant information.
- **Voice and Text Responses**: Users can interact with the chatbot using both voice and text input. The chatbot provides responses in both voice and text format for a seamless user experience.
- **Medical Information**: The chatbot is equipped with a knowledge base of medical information and can provide users with information on symptoms, diseases, treatments, and more.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user inputs and historical data, the chatbot can offer personalized recommendations and suggestions for maintaining health and wellness.

## Installation

To run the Healthcare Chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Healthcare-Chatbot.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the application and interact with the chatbot using text or voice input.

## Usage

- Upon launching the application, users can interact with the chatbot by typing messages or speaking into the microphone.
- Users can ask questions about symptoms, medical conditions, treatments, and more.
- The chatbot analyzes the user's query, retrieves relevant information from its knowledge base, and provides a response in text and/or voice format.
- Users can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions or seeking additional information.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot application.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: Libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn are used for natural language understanding and processing.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Libraries: Libraries such as pyttsx3 or gTTS are used for converting text responses into speech.
- Speech Recognition Libraries: Libraries such as SpeechRecognition are used for converting voice input into text.
